- [x] preview on different backgrounds (transparent, light, dark, custom generated)

- [x] shorthand links to select/deselect all viepoints
- [x] clean up icons in Design section
- [x] in the main preview, add columns and rows headers
- [x] ctrl+enter should trigger regeneration
- [x] add clickable prompt suggestions
- [x] new app name "Pixel-art Spritesheet Creator"
- [x] make the click on saved desing automatically load the design

## bugs

- [ ] magenta as a key color for transparency is not working properly (leaving some artefacts)
- [x] generate sprite sheet base character preview is streached and zoomed too much
- [x] deleting designs does not work
- [x] main preview initial zoom is too large
